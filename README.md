# WSN Simulators

This repository contains simulation tools for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), including classical and machine learning–based Cluster-Head (CH) selection protocols.

## Contents

- `WSN_Sim_LEACH_v0.py` – Basic LEACH protocol simulator.
- `WSN_Sim_LEACH_GA.py` – LEACH with Genetic Algorithm–based CH selection.
- `WSN_Sim_GWO.py` – Grey Wolf Optimizer–based CH selection.
- `WSN_Sim_ML.py` – CH selection using trained machine learning models.
- `WSN_ML_Toolkit.py` – Toolkit for training and evaluating ML models on WSN data.

## Usage

Each script can be run standalone using Python:

```bash
python WSN_Sim_LEACH_v0.py
