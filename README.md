# WSN Simulators

This repository contains simulation tools for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), including classical and machine learning–based Cluster-Head (CH) selection protocols.

## Contents

- `LEACH.py` – Basic LEACH protocol simulator.
- `LEACH_GA.py` – LEACH with Genetic Algorithm–based CH selection.
- `GWO.py` – Grey Wolf Optimizer–based CH selection.
- `ML_Sim.py` – CH selection using trained machine learning models.
- `ML_Toolkit.py` – Toolkit for training and evaluating ML models on WSN data.
- `parameters_variations.json` - Parameters variations.

## Usage

Each script can be run standalone using Python:

```bash
python LEACH.py
